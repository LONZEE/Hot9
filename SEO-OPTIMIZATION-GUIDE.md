gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');

<!-- Line 27: Replace with your actual Facebook Pixel ID -->
fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID_HERE');
src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=YOUR_PIXEL_ID_HERE&ev=PageView&noscript=1"

<!-- Line 38: Replace with your actual Google Ads ID -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
gtag('config', 'AW-XXXXXXXXXX');
```

   ```html
   <img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="...">
   ```
